## Installation
If you haven't already done so, install [grunt-init][].

Once grunt-init is installed, place this template in your `~/.grunt-init/` directory. It's recommended that you use git to clone this template into that directory, as follows:

```
git clone https://github.com/dreamerhyde/grunt-init-mkdir.git ~/.grunt-init/mkdir
```

_(Windows users, see [the documentation][grunt-init] for the correct destination directory path)_

## Usage

At the command-line, cd into an empty directory, run this command and follow the prompts.

```
grunt-init mkdir
```

This template tries to structure your website project folders, you could put your sources into "src" folder which contents javascripts(js), images(img), stylesheets(css, sass). One more thing, you could also put your compressed files into "dist" folder if you want.
